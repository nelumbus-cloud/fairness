# AI Fairness Classifier Comparison

This project implements the experimental setup described in the paper "A Comparative Empirical Study of Inherent Fairness Across Standard Machine Learning Classifiers".

It provides two main pipelines:
1.  `preprocess.py`: To preprocess the four benchmark datasets.
2.  `train.py`: To tune and evaluate the five classifiers on the preprocessed data.
